  <p>
    Kalimantan, Indonesia, also known as Borneo, is the third largest island in the world. It is located in the middle of the Malay Archipelago in Southeast Asia, with a forest coverage rate of 80%. But in 1986, the Indonesian economy collapsed. In order to promote economic development and get out of the predicament, the government began to open up palm oil development. After acquiring villagers' land, palm oil companies usually cut the land completely and then plant oil palm trees. After 25-30 years of economic life of oil palm trees, such land usually requires a lot of energy and money to restore. Ahifi, the project leader of the Kalimantan Island project of the KEHATI Foundation, said that the initial restoration of the forest will take 35 years and more than three times the funds. Therefore, most companies are reluctant to spend extra money and labor, and choose to cut more virgin forests.

  <h2>The wildlifes</h2>
  <img src="" alt="">
  <p>Orangutans are one of the four great apes in the world (gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans). They are the only apes in Asia. They only live in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia and Malaysia). Orangutans who have lost their homes and food will be forced to enter the palm groves in search of the only food source-palm saplings, and are therefore regarded by palm oil companies as "pests" of farmland and killed. From 1986 to 2016, the number of orangutans on Kalimantan has dropped by about 60%.</p>
